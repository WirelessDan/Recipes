 Ingredients

    1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

    1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk

    3 large eggs

    1 (15 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

    1 teaspoon vanilla extract

    2 Tbsp Sugar (if you like)

    2 Tbsp Lemon Juice

Directions

    1.
    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (163 degrees C).

    2.
    Place sugar in an even layer in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the edges start to brown, about 1 minute; drag sugar into the center with a spatula once the edges start to brown. Continue cooking, stirring from time to time, until caramel is an even golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour into container.

    3.
    Place sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, cream cheese, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until smooth.

    Meanwhile, pour 1 inch boiling water into a large oven-safe pot or baking dish to make a water bath.

    4.
    Set the flan and water bath in the preheated oven; bake 52 minutes and gently cool.

    Chill flan in the refrigerator until firm, 2 to 3 hours. Invert onto a serving plate so that caramel is on top.
